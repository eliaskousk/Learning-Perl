# Chapter 06 Workbook Exercise 03/4
# Modify the program from Exercise 6.1 so it prompts for the user for a name, 
# and then reports the birthday for that name.
#
# AND
# 
# What happens in your program for Exercise 6.3 if the user-entered 
# name is in the hash, but does not have a birthday? Add a couple of 
# entries to the hash: one with a value of undef, and one with a value 
# of the empty string. Modify your program for Exercise 6.3 to tell 
# the user that you donâ€™t know the birthday if the key is in the hash, 
# but does not have a value.
#
# (Combined 3 & 4 together, since I seem to have skipped over 3, but 
# still did it anyhow.)
#
# usage:
#   exw06-04.pl 
#
# output:
#   enter a person's name: 
#   Name, January 1
