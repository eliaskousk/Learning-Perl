Learning-Perl
=============

Going through the "Learning Perl" book, one chapter at a time.  Will also include exercises from the Learning Perl Student Workbook.

### UPDATE: COMPLETE!

This exercise is now complete. From the first commit on Oct 20, 2014 (over 820 days - 2Â¼ years ago!), through 18 branches and 205 commits, I have arrived at the end. There will be no more commits to this repository after this one. Thank you for following along. 

### RESUME README.

The objectives of this exercise are as follows:

+ refresh my perl skills. I was more than proficient at one point, but lack of coding in anything other than bash for three years makes me feel like I need to refresh from the start.  I'd like to return to the state I was at, and continue to the master level.
+ master git. I'm competent, using it regularly it work, but I want to do more. 
+ push myself. I am trying to motivate myself to do something interesting. 

Sounds reasonable, doesn't it? 

Why am I anonymous, though?  It's because I kinda want to just do this for myself, but in a public manner, so that I can be humiliated by people I don't know, rather than people that I do.  :-D
