# Chapter 14 Workbook Exercise 06
# -------------------------------
# Create two arrays, one for the first names and one for the last names, 
# for the Flintstones characters such that the elements in each array align 
# with each other. Go through only one of the arrays with each and use the 
# array index to access the other array. For each character, output their 
# first and last names on the same line, with every characterâ€™s full name 
# on a separate line.
